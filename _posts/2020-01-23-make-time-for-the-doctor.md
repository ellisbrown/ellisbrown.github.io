> *I originally posted this on Instagram a little over a week ago.  After hearing that dozens of people had decided to make doctors appointments after seeing my post, I felt compelled to formalize the message here so that it could reach more people.*

Two weeks ago, I underwent open heart surgery. I am blessed to have been supported by my family throughout, and to have had the best healthcare imaginable. The procedure went perfectly and I should be better than ever in a couple of months.

If you told me a year ago I would need open heart surgery just after turning 25, I would have thought you were crazy. Just like most new college grads, I had felt healthy and invincible for as long as I could remember.

Last spring I made an appointment with a neurologist regarding infrequent migraines I had been having.  Luckily my case is nothing more than a nuisance, but it was something rather unexpected that struck me from my visit.  When the doctor asked me who my PCP (primary care physician) was, I was at a loss for words.

I had seen the same pediatrician since I was a kid and even through my college years over the summers; in my two and a half years on my own in the real world, getting a routine checkup had not even crossed my mind. I was preoccupied with work and life in a new city. But hey, I was healthy and finding a doctor is nearly impossible when you’re working full-time (in fact, I had pushed off seeing this one for a year or more!).  He gave me a bit of a hard time about it and pointed me to a couple of good PCPs to look up.

Luckily I listened, and carved out the time to schedule a physical.

All the tests looked great as expected, but my new PCP remarked that I had a heart murmur (abnormal sounding heartbeat). I had known about the murmur my whole life — I’d had it checked out when I was younger and it was no big deal. The doctor said I should follow up with a cardiologist to get it checked in depth, just to be safe.

A couple of weeks and a barrage of tests later, I was diagnosed with a congenital heart valve defect that was causing my aortic valve to deteriorate and my aortic root to enlarge. If I didn't get it fixed or replaced in the next year or two, my valve could go beyond repair and I would have an aneurysm, likely before my 30s.

In the grand scheme of things, my healthcare scare has been relatively manageable.  There are a lot of conditions that would have been much worse to be diagnosed with. I was lucky to find out about my condition when I did, and luckier still to have had access to such great doctors. I was able to have a surgery to repair my valve and aortic root, and my heart is now healthier than ever.

Unexpected health issues can arise in your mid-twenties, even if you feel perfectly fine! Believe me, I know it is hard to make time, but a couple of hours now could give you 60 years.
