I am a MSCS student at CMU, primarily interested in decision making and reinforcement learning. My goal is to develop intelligent agents that can adapt and *generalize* as well as humans do, allowing them to be *safely* deployed in the real world. Recently, I am particularly excited about model-based / unsupervised / hierarchical / meta learning.

Previously, I was a founding ML Engineer at [BlackRock AI Labs](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai) in Palo Alto working on projects at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and finance. Before that, I studied computer science and mathematics at Vanderbilt University, where I was a research assistant in [Maithilee Kunda](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/)'s [lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab/) working on computational cognitive science and artificial intelligence. 

Over the past couple of years, I have also taken non-degree graduate machine learning courses at Columbia and Stanford while working in NYC and Palo Alto.

I am a proud member of the [Osage Nation](https://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/) and have recently enjoyed engaging with the Native research community at [AISES](https://conference.aises.org/).
