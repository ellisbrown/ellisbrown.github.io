I am a MSCS student at CMU, primarily interested in artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning.
Recently, I am particularly excited about generalization, exploration, and model-based / unsupervised / hierarchical learning.
I am also generally interested in drawing inspiration from intelligence in humans and nature.
My long-term goal is to develop intelligent agents that can generalize and continually adapt as robustly and efficiently as humans do, allowing them to be *safely* deployed in the real world.

Previously I was a founding engineer at [BlackRock AI Labs](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai) in Palo Alto, where I was fortunate to work with 
[Mykel Kochenderfer](https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/),
[Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/),
and [Trevor Hastie](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/)
on projects at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and finance. Before that, I studied computer science and mathematics at Vanderbilt University, where I was a research assistant in [Maithilee Kunda](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/)'s [lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab/) working on computational cognitive science and artificial intelligence. 

Over the past couple of years, I have also taken non-degree graduate machine learning courses at Columbia and Stanford while working in NYC and Palo Alto.

I am a proud member of the [Osage Nation](https://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/) and have recently enjoyed engaging with the Native research community at [AISES](https://conference.aises.org/).

Lastly: if you haven't made time for a regular checkin with a doctor recently, [please do](/life/make-time-for-the-doctor/)! Even if you feel perfectly healthy.
