I am a Machine Learning Engineer at BlackRock AI Labs in NYC working on projects at the intersection of Statistical Learning, Optimization, and Finance.

Over the past couple of years, I have also taken non-degree graduate Machine Learning courses at Stanford and Columbia.

I graduated in May 2017 from Vanderbilt University with degrees in Computer Science and Math. As a senior, I was a research assistant in [Maithilee Kunda](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/)'s [lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab/) where I led a computational cognitive science project. After my junior year, I was a software-engineering intern at BlackRock in NYC.

<!-- I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and its potential to extend humanity's ability to solve challenging problems. I believe that there is a lot to learn about learning from studying us humans and other intelligent animals, but also do not. -->

I am a proud member of the [Osage Nation](https://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/) and have recently enjoyed engaging with the Native research community at [AISES](https://conference.aises.org/).
