I am a MSCS student at CMU, primarily interested in decision making and reinforcement learning. My goal is to develop intelligent agents that can generalize as robustly and efficiently as humans do, allowing them to be *safely* deployed in the real world. Recently, I am particularly excited about model-based / unsupervised / hierarchical learning and exploration.

Previously, I was a founding ML Engineer at [BlackRock AI Labs](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai) in Palo Alto working with 
[Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/), [Mykel Kochenderfer](https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/), and [Trevor Hastie](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/)
 on projects at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and finance. Before that, I studied computer science and mathematics at Vanderbilt University, where I was a research assistant in [Maithilee Kunda](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/)'s [lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab/) working on computational cognitive science and artificial intelligence. 

Over the past couple of years, I have also taken non-degree graduate machine learning courses at Columbia and Stanford while working in NYC and Palo Alto.

I am a proud member of the [Osage Nation](https://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/) and have recently enjoyed engaging with the Native research community at [AISES](https://conference.aises.org/).
