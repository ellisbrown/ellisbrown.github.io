Hello! I am a Machine Learning Engineer at BlackRock AI Labs in NYC working on projects at the intersection of Big Data, Machine Learning, and Finance.  I am also a non-degree Graduate Student at Columbia University.

I graduated in May 2017 from Vanderbilt University with degrees in Computer Science and Math. As a senior, I was a research assistant in [Maithilee Kunda](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/)'s [lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab/) where I led a computational cognitive science project. After my junior year, I was a software-engineering intern at BlackRock in NYC.

I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, especially in methods that do not require excessive amounts of data/compute. I think that we have a ton to learn about learning from looking at how humans and animals are able to learn. I also believe that the progress of developments in AI could be sudden and dramatic, and am interested in striving to have safe systems that are aligned with humans.

I am a proud member of the [Osage Nation](https://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/) and have recently enjoyed engaging with the Native research community at [AISES](https://conference.aises.org/).
