I am a Master's student in the [Computer Science Department](http://csd.cmu.edu/) at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) and a graduate student researcher in the [Robitics Institute](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Deepak Pathak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak/) and collaborate closely with [Alyosha Efros](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~efros/).
My recent interests are in self-supervised learning, curiosity-based exploration, and leveraging internet-scale models and data.
I am keen to draw inspiration from intelligence in humans and nature---especially as a goal-post rather than a blueprint.
My long-term goal is to develop intelligent agents that can *generalize* and *continually adapt* as robustly and efficiently as humans do, allowing them to be *safely* deployed in the real world.

Previously I was a founding engineer at [BlackRock AI Labs](http://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai) in Palo Alto, where I was fortunate to work with 
[Mykel Kochenderfer](http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/),
[Stephen Boyd](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/),
and [Trevor Hastie](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/)
on projects at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and finance. Before that, I studied computer science and mathematics at [Vanderbilt](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/), and was an undergraduate student researcher in [Maithilee Kunda](http://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/)'s [lab](http://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab/) working on computational cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

Over the past couple of years, I have also taken non-degree graduate machine learning courses at [Columbia](http://www.columbia.edu/) and [Stanford](http://www.stanford.edu/) while working in NYC and Palo Alto.

I am a proud member of the [Osage Nation](http://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/) and have recently enjoyed engaging with the Native research community at [AISES](http://conference.aises.org/).

Lastly: if you haven't made time for a regular checkin with a doctor recently, [please do](/life/make-time-for-the-doctor/)! Even if you feel perfectly healthy.
