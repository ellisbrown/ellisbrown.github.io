I am currently a MSCS student at Carnegie Mellon, primarily interested in decision making and reinforcement learning. My goal is to develop intelligent agents that can adapt and generalize as well as humans do, allowing them to be safely deployed in the real world. I am excited about model-based, unsupervised, hierarchical, and meta learning.

Previously, I was a founding ML Engineer at [BlackRock AI Labs](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai) in Palo Alto working on projects at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and finance. Before that, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Vanderbilt University, where I was a research assistant in [Maithilee Kunda](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/)'s [lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/aivaslab/) working on computational cognitive science and artificial intelligence. 

Over the past couple of years, I have also taken non-degree graduate Machine Learning courses at Stanford and Columbia while working.

I am a proud member of the [Osage Nation](https://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/) and have recently enjoyed engaging with the Native research community at [AISES](https://conference.aises.org/).
