I am a CS PhD Student at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/) advised by Profs. [Saining Xie](https://www.sainingxie.com/) and [Rob Fergus](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus).
My research is supported by the [NDSEG Fellowship](https://www.ndseg.org/).
I have interned at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (w/ [Shengyi Qian](https://jasonqsy.github.io)) and at [Ai2 PRIOR](https://prior.allenai.org/) (w/ [Ross Girshick](https://www.rossgirshick.info/)).

Before NYU, I graduated from a Master's at [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I was advised by Profs. [Deepak Pathak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak/) and [Alyosha Efros](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~efros/).
Before that, I was a founding research engineer at [BlackRock AI Labs](http://www.blackrock.com/ai), working with Profs.

and a non-degree grad student at [Stanford](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/) and [Columbia](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/).
I did my undergrad at [Vanderbilt](http://www.vanderbilt.edu) where I majored in CS & Math and did research in CogSci & Vision with Prof. [Maithilee Kunda](http://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/).
I'm originally from St. Louis, MO and am a proud member of the [Osage Nation](http://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/).
