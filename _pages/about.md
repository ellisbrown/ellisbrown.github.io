<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a Master's student in the [Computer Science Department](http://csd.cmu.edu/) at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) and a graduate student researcher in the [Robotics Institute](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/) affiliated with [CMU Vision](https://cmu-vision.github.io/). I am advised by [Deepak Pathak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak/) and [Alyosha Efros](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~efros/).

Previously I was a founding engineer at [BlackRock AI Labs](http://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai), where I was fortunate to work with 
[Mykel Kochenderfer](http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/),
[Stephen Boyd](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/),
and [Trevor Hastie](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/)
on projects in machine learning, optimization, and big data applied to finance.
While working in Palo Alto and NYC, I was a non-degree computer science graduate student at [Stanford](http://www.stanford.edu/) and [Columbia](http://www.columbia.edu/).
Before that, I studied computer science and mathematics at [Vanderbilt](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/) and worked on computational cognitive science and artificial intelligence with [Maithilee Kunda](http://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/).
