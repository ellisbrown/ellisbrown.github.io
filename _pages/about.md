<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.com) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a CS PhD Student at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/) advised by [Saining Xie](https://www.sainingxie.com/) and [Rob Fergus](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus).
I recently graduated from a Master's at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I was advised by [Deepak Pathak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak/) and [Alyosha Efros](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~efros/).
Before that, I was a founding research engineer at [BlackRock AI Labs](http://www.blackrock.com/ai), where I was fortunate to work with
[Mykel Kochenderfer](http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/),
[Stephen Boyd](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/),
and [Trevor Hastie](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/)
on applied research & finance.
I earned Bachelors degrees in CS & Math from [Vanderbilt University](http://www.vanderbilt.edu), where I worked on CoCoSci & Vision with [Maithilee Kunda](http://my.vanderbilt.edu/mkunda/). I'm originally from St. Louis, MO.
