After hearing that dozens of people had decided to make doctors appointments after seeing my post, I was compelled to formalize the message here so that it could reach more people.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><img class="align-right col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" src="/assets/posts/doctor/bed.jpg"></p> <p>If you told me a year ago I would need open-heart surgery just after turning 25, I would have thought you were crazy. Just like most new college grads, I had felt healthy and invincible for as long as I could remember.</p> <p>Last spring I made an appointment with a neurologist regarding infrequent migraines I had been having. Luckily my case is nothing more than a nuisance, but something unexpected struck me from my visit: I was at a loss for words when the doctor asked me who my PCP (primary care physician) was.</p> <p>I had seen the same pediatrician since I was a kid, even over the summers while in college; in my two and a half years on my own in the real world, getting a routine checkup had not even crossed my mind. I was preoccupied with work and life in a new city. But hey, I was healthy and finding a doctor is nearly impossible when you’re working full-time. He gave me a bit of a hard time about it and pointed me to a couple of good PCPs to look up.</p> <p>Luckily I listened.</p> <p>I carved out the time and scheduled a physical with a new PCP. All the tests looked great as expected, but he remarked that I had a heart murmur (abnormal sounding heartbeat). I had known about the murmur my whole life—I’d had it checked out when I was younger and it was supposedly no big deal. The doctor said I should follow up with a cardiologist to get it checked in-depth, just to be safe.</p> <p><img class="align-left col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" src="/assets/posts/doctor/scar.jpg"></p> <p>A couple of weeks and a barrage of tests later, I was diagnosed with a congenital heart valve defect that was causing my aortic valve to deteriorate and my aortic root to enlarge. If I didn’t get it fixed or replaced in the next year or two, my valve could go beyond repair and I would have an aneurysm, likely before my 30s.</p> <p>In the grand scheme of things, my health scare has been relatively manageable. There are a lot of diagnoses that would have been much worse. I was lucky to find out about my condition when I did, and luckier still to have had access to such great doctors. I was able to have surgery to repair my valve and aortic root, and my heart is now healthier than ever.</p> <p>Unexpected health issues can arise in your mid-twenties, even if you <em>feel</em> perfectly fine! I know how hard it is to make time, but a couple of hours to get a checkup now could give you 60 years.</p> <p><br></p> <blockquote> <p>If you read this and want to chat, <em>please</em> do not hestitate to reach out. I’m especially happy to hear from people who were inspired to make a doctor’s appointment after reading this—hopefully all is well, but I sure can commiserate if it isn’t. Even if you just feel like breaking the ice and acknowledging you’ve read this or asking a question about the experience, that is fine too!</p> </blockquote> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Ellis L.
